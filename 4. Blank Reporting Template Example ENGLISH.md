Technical Report

This is a Detailed Technical Report which you could use to report any vulnerabilities found on Bug Bounty Platforms or Responsible Disclosure Program.

Vulnerability Name: Filename parameter on Home Page - "https://example.com/home" is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Vulnerable URL/Area: https://example.com/home- Home Page

Vulnerable Form/Parameter: Filename parameter

Vulnerability Description: The Filename parameter on the Home Page (https://example.com/home) is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks. By sending a POST request to the server with a specially crafted payload in the Filename parameter (e.g., ../../../../../../etc/passwd), an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the server. This payload allows the attacker to traverse the directory structure and access system files such as the "/etc/passwd" file, which contains user account information. The lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the Filename parameter enables this security risk, exposing the application to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive server information.

Severity: Critical

Risk Rating: High

CVE: CVE-2023-31904

CWE-ID CWE-22

CVSS Score: 8.6 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

Vulnerability Class: Broken Access Control

Impact of Vulnerability: The vulnerability of Local File Inclusion (LFI) on the home page "https://example.com/home" can be attributed to the impact of the filename parameter. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the filename parameter in the URL to include arbitrary local files from the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially access sensitive system files, confidential information, or execute malicious code on the server.

Steps to Reproduce: Go to the Home Page (https://example.com/home).

Select any file from the selection section.

Intercept the request in the Burp Suite Proxy tool and send it to the request repeater tab in Burp Suite Proxy tool.

Change the value of the "filename" parameter to the payload (../../../../../etc/passwd).

In the response section, you will be able to see the sensitive data being disclosed.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

Request:

http POST /home HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

filename=../../../../../etc/passwd Response:

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin ... Screenshot:

Mitigation Steps for Local File Inclusion Implement input validation and sanitize user input: Prevent the inclusion of unauthorized file paths or malicious input.

Avoid using user-supplied input directly in file inclusion functions: Instead, use a whitelist approach or predefined file mappings.

Use absolute file paths or well-defined relative paths: Ensure that files are accessed from the intended locations only.

Apply appropriate access controls and permissions: Restrict file inclusion to authorized directories or files.

Regularly update and patch your software and frameworks: Address any known vulnerabilities.
